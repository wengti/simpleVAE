# simpleVAE

## Credits & Acknowledgments  
This project is a reimplementation of [VAE-Pytorch] by [explainingai-code] (https://github.com/explainingai-code/VAE-Pytorch).  
The code has been rewritten from scratch while maintaining the core concepts and functionalities of the original implementation.  

## Features  
- **extract_mnist.py** - Extracts MNIST data from the CSV file.  
- **load_data.py** - Creates a custom dataset.  
- **engine.py** - Defines the train and test steps (for 1 epoch).  
- **main.py** - Trains the model and performs inference (image reconstruction).
